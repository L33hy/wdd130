                <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the most populous country on the African continent 
                    and is known for its rich cultural diversity, with over 250 distinct ethnic groups 
                    and languages. Its capital city is Abuja, while Lagos serves as its largest 
                    and most economically vibrant city. Nigeria boasts a significant role in Africa's 
                    political and economic landscape, with an economy driven by oil production, agriculture, 
                    and a burgeoning tech industry. However, the country also faces social and economic 
                    challenges, including issues related to governance, infrastructure, and healthcare. 
                    Despite these challenges, Nigeria's vibrant music, art, and literature scenes 
                    contribute to its dynamic cultural heritage and global influence.
